									</strong>
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									From basic conception to final design, our developers are focused on turning your marketing and business strategies into websites that deliver results. Our capabilities cover a full range of website development expertise including the latest HTML5 and other programming languages, content and organic search strategies, content management systems, ecommerce, database design, back-end integration, multimedia features, and more.
Our websites help organizations like yours maximize the way online visitors experience your brand. To achieve this we make updates and ongoing maintenance easy. Once a site is live, your team (or ours, if you like) can make copy and image changes as needed through easy-to-use content management tools.

										<h4 class="m_title">WEBSITE STRATEGY THAT GUIDES DESIGN</h4>
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									For many web developers, it’s all about how a website looks. For us, it’s about how a website performs.
At IT Rovers, the most important part of website design is assuring that the outcome meets your goals. Before the first line of code is written, we sit down with you to review your business, usability, and marketing objectives to plan the web strategy. Our planning process takes into consideration site navigation, search engine optimization, link building, and strategies for capturing detailed information about your site visitors through personalized opt-in opportunities as well as through general website analytics.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
								We make your website work harder because we work harder to understand – and achieve – your website goals.
								</p>

									<strong> 
										<h4 class="m_title">MICROSITES THAT INCREASE RESPONSE</h4>
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Microsite landing pages and pURLs (personal URLs) shorten the distance between website entry and final destination. Organizations that integrate pURLs and other microsite strategies into their marketing mix typically experience much higher response rates. Why? Because they don’t waste visitors’ time by making them hunt for information.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									A pURL is a microsite designed just for a particular visitor. Populated with dynamically-generated, customized content gathered from user inputs and/or database records, pURLS get immediate recognition and drive response. A pURL is even more powerful when combined with other types of marketing tools as part of an integrated marketing campaign.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									IT Rovers Interactive has years of experience delivering successful microsite landing pages and pURLs for clients.

								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Let IT Rovers help you deploy mobile strategies that reach on-the-go users to quickly generate leads, create loyal customers and drive sales.
