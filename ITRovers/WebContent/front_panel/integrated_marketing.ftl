										<h4 class="m_title">INTEGRATE INTERACTIVE MARKETING WITH PRINT MEDIA</h4>
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									QR (quick response) codes are one of the most versatile cross-channel tools used by marketers today. Adapted from industrial applications, they have become an ally of marketers who want to maximize the information they offer customers but have limited space to do it.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Marketers add QR codes to post cards, printed ads, business cards, in-store signage, email messages, even TV commercials. Smartphone users can scan the QR images to display text or open a web microsite to see more information or – even – respond in real-time to messages.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Want to implement QR codes in your next project? Talk to IT Rovers about our end-to-end management service: from cross-channel implementation to results analysis.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Can we show a QR code on the webpage that links to a sample illustration of a QR code? We have a IT Rovers DocBuilder postcard that we’ve used a QR code on. It would need some adjusting but we could provide this artwork. By using our own sample, we wouldn’t have to get a customer approval. But if we have a customer sample, that would be optimal.

										<h4 class="m_title">INTEGRATE DIRECT MAIL AND EMAIL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS</h4>
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Trying to migrate from printed direct mail to email marketing but not sure if your audience is ready for the move? Maybe you need to reach a mixed audience with a communication that requires both email and direct mail components.
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Integrating email and direct mail campaigns effectively is tricky as it requires coordinating a consistent campaign strategy across multiple service providers, all with different skills and needs. Just finding the best resources could be daunting as it includes: direct mail and email copywriters, graphic print designers, digital email designers, a qualified mail house, an email service provider, and some way of obtaining full contact address lists as well as email addresses. And once a campaign is executed, how do you analyze cross-channel effectiveness?
								</p>
								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									The easy answer is: call IT Rovers. We’ll do it all – from start to finish – for you. We’ll even do the multi-channel analysis so you can be sure of your results.
