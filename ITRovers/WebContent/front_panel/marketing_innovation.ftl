								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									Today’s marketing channels have their own set of rules. Each one demands special technology requirements and expertise. Those discrepancies make it harder for marketers to develop solutions across disciplines. The Marketing Innovation Center @ IT Rovers defies this trend. It breaks down barriers between marketing silos to facilitate understanding and synchronicity across them. Not just metaphorically. Not just virtually. But physically as well. Few marketing service providers have gone to these lengths to provide integrated services for their customers.

								<p style="text-align: justify;">
									The result: Our customers benefit from a unique blend of expertise that simply doesn’t happen in traditional agencies.
